      <article>
        A Trail-blazing member of the pioneering generation of post-independence
        African literature giants, Florence Onyebuchi “Buchi” Emecheta, died in
        London on January 25 at the age of 72 and the word is the poorer for it.
        Born of Igbo parents from Nigeria’s oil-rich Delta region in July 1944,
        her father was a railway worker who died when she was nine. She was
        brought up by her mother in the cosmopolitan colonial capital of Lagos,
        having to convince her parents to let her join her brother to go to
        school. She won a scholarship to Methodist Girls’ High School at 10, but
        left school seven years later, marrying Sylvester Onwordi to whom she
        had been engaged since she was 11. <br />
